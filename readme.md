# KrishlayP

Welcome! This is the personal playground and portfolio of Krishlay — a tinkerer, builder, and lifelong learner. Here you'll find projects, experiments, and notes that reflect curiosity, creativity, and the occasional delightful mess.

## What you'll find here

- Small projects that solve everyday problems (sometimes elegantly, sometimes hilariously).
- Learning experiments: code snippets, prototypes, and notes from things I'm exploring.
- Tools and utilities I use to make life a bit easier.
- Honest write-ups: lessons learned, mistakes made, and the weird little wins.

## Featured Projects

- Project A — a fun demo that shows off a neat trick.
- Project B — a utility I use to automate a boring task.
- Project C — a learning prototype (expect unfinished ideas and playful code).

(Full project list appears in the projects folder — take a peek!)

## How to use this repo

- Browse the folders to find code or notes.
- Open an issue if something inspires you or if you want to collaborate.
